# Comparison
`ddginternal` and `duckduckgo-search` is essentially the same thing.

The core difference is that our code base is Rust-supported and... a bit "easier."

## Speed
The speed is essentially the same since we're both parsing the Javascript contents.

## Typing
We added typing for everything. Including `primp`, if you're interested in contributing. Rust bindings are all typed within `.pyi` files.
