Cocoa has been consumed in some form for at least 5,300 years starting with the Mayo-Chinchipe culture in what is present-day Ecuador. Later Mesoamerican civilizations also consumed chocolate beverages, and it was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. The seeds of the cacao tree have an intense bitter taste and must be fermented to develop the flavor. After fermentation, the seeds are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor may also be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter.\", source=\"Wikipedia\", url=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate\", answer=\"\", definition=\"\", entity=\"food\", heading=\"Chocolate\", image=\"/i/f5810b7016c536ea.jpg\", infobox=[Infobox(label=\"\\\"Region or state\\\"\", value=\"\\\"Mesoamerica\\\"\"), Infobox(label=\"\\\"Main ingredients\\\"\", value=\"\\\"Cocoa bean\\\"\"), Infobox(label=\"\\\"Variations\\\"\", value=\"\\\"Chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa solids, solid chocolate\\\"\"), Infobox(label=\"\\\"Wikidata description\\\"\", value=\"\\\"nutritionally dense or sweet food product from the seed of Theobroma cacao - cocoa bean\\\"\"), Infobox(label=\"\\\"Wikidata id\\\"\", value=\"\\\"Q195\\\"\"), Infobox(label=\"\\\"Wikidata label\\\"\", value=\"\\\"chocolate\\\"\"), Infobox(label=\"\\\"Wikidata aliases\\\"\", value=\"[\\\"chocolate\\\"]\")])\n</code></pre> <p>You can then get each result of a category, and use it everywhere in your apps.</p>"},{"location":"basics/#using-modules","title":"Using modules","text":"<p>On top of the regular search results (for example, web links), DuckDuckGo tends to load modules to make the results even more complete, but those require conccurent requests thus it's not enabled by default.

For example, you might want to search boba shops near you, you can do:</p> Python<pre><code>from ddginternal import search\n\nresult, mod = search(\"chocolate cookies\", modules=[\"recipes\"])\n\nif mod.recipes:\n    recipe = mod.recipes.results[0]\n    print(\"#\", recipe.title)\n    print(recipe.summary)\n    print(\"score:\", recipe.spoonacular_score)\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>result</code> is same as the above, but an additional module is returned.
